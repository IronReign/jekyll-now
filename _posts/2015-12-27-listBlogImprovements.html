<title> General Blog Improvements </title>

By Caitlin <br />

<h3>Task: Make blog more accessible and simpler to write for</h3>
<p>
   In a rough order, here are the things I've worked on in the blog over the past month or so:
     <ul>
       <li>Add a readable nav-bar and fix header text color </li>
       <li>Add About page structure for new members to fill in </li>
       <li>Resize a bunch of images to fit the 600 px width, and a couple that were too tall </li>
       <li>Create tag-specific post pages </li>
       <li>Make these tag pages Case-Insensitive so posters could tag &quot;Design&quot; or &quot;design&quot; </li>
       <li>Add Div wrappers around newly created pages so the margins work </li>
       <li>Add a Date limit on the printable version of the blog so only this season's posts print </li>
     </ul>
</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
   The first draft of the tag page came from <a href="http://christianspecht.de/2014/10/25/separate-pages-per-tag-category-with-jekyll-without-plugins/"> Christian Specht's great guide.</a> This created a bulleted list of all posts in that tag, which I edited to show the post content in the same way the main page does. The drawback with this method is that it is Case-Sensitive, and a new folder and index page must be made for the individual tags you want to access.

   The code from the above guide is <br /> <code> &#123;&#37; for post in site.tags[page.tag] &#37;&#125;</code> <br /> while to make the search Case-Insensitive I needed <br /> <code> &#123;&#37; for post in site.posts &#37;&#125;<br />
   &#123;&#37; assign tagArray = "" | split: "/" &#37;&#125;<br />
   &#123;&#37; for item in post.tags &#37;&#125;<br />
       &#123;&#37; assign tagDowncased = item | downcase &#37;&#125;<br />
       &#123;&#37; assign tagArray = tagArray | push: tagDowncased &#37;&#125;<br />
   &#123;&#37; endfor &#37;&#125;<br />
  &#123;&#37; if tagArray contains page.tag &#37;&#125; </code> <br />
  2nd version from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34241808/downcase-a-liquid-object"> this stackoverflow question </a>
</p>
<p>
When we print our blog out to give to judges, we use a different version of the main index page that doesn't truncate the post. Last year we didn't have to worry about printing old posts, but now we needed a way to stop when a certain date was reached. This may seem like a trivial thing, just add an if statement in the already existing loop, but liquid isn't the most cooperative of languages. 
I couldn't find someone with the exact question as my own, but<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9623719/only-return-jekyll-posts-that-match-specific-year"> this question about matching years </a> was similar enough to give me a place to start. I used the <a href="https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/filters/additional-filters#date"> Shopify website's date filter guide </a> and this extremely helpful <a href= "http://cheat.markdunkley.com/"> Shopify Cheat Sheet </a> to get the date as "YYYYMMDD" 
This returned the date as a String, which was <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27198710/convert-string-to-integer-in-shopify-liquid">converted to an integer by adding 0.</a> <br />
Final version: <br /> <code> &#123;&#37; for post in site.posts &#37;&#125;<br />
  &#123;&#37; capture comparableDate &#37;&#125; &#123;&#123; post.date | date: "&#37;Y&#37;m&#37;d" &#125;&#125; &#123;&#37; endcapture &#37;&#125;<br />
  &#123;&#37; assign comparableDate = comparableDate | plus: 0 &#37;&#125;<br />
	&#123;&#37; if comparableDate >= 20150424 &#37;&#125;</code>

The blog back-end probably won't be touched during normal practice times anymore as competition deadlines are threateningly close.
