<h4> Task: Finalize ball collector </h4>
<p>
This week we finished updating the ball collector. This is a major accomplishment, since this is a very important part of the machine, and is the first step towards
the ability to score. Our finishing the collector now allows us to concentrate on the tube joint and figure out how to finish the entire scoring mechanism to have
it ready for the competition. We are thinking about making a whole new robot that is centered around the placement of the rolling goal. This would allow for efficient 
scoring of the balls and a central system to elevate the balls for scoring.
<h4> Reflection: </h4>
Finalizing our scoring system is allowing us to pay more attention to things like the blog and learning Creo. With our spread of knowledge throughout the robot game, we have a nice chance
to finish soon and introduce driving practice.
