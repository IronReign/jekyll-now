On August 7, 2015 we tried to inspire returning DISD students to think of themselves as budding engineers and scientists. At the Mayor's Back to School Fair and as guests of Dallas City of Learning, we demonstrated our creations to Mayor Rawlings and hundreds of kids. Many students learned to operate the robots and learned about robotics opportunities available to them at all levels in Dallas ISD.

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
We were in the historic Women's Building at Fair Park.  It's a beautiful building, but foot traffic was not great 
since it was separated from the main buildings. The kids who did come through still got a kick out of Kibosh.  We had it
slowed down so they could control and play with it directly. Mayor Rawlings was really nice and seemed genuinely 
intersested in what we were doing and especially that we were doing so much over the summer. He is really concerned
about summer learning loss and that's part of why he is backing the <a href="www.dallascityoflearning.org">Dallas City of Learning initiative</a>. 
Omar spent a lot
of time touring the building with Argos and even taught Mayor Rawlings how to operate it.  
And our story did get featured in the school's first newsletter this year.
