<h4> Task: Create blogs to showcase our ideas and help share our design updates as they go</h4>
<p>
Blog production will be our main asset to showcase a journal to the judges on competition day.
 Github is the blog provider we have so today was the day we really concentrated on organizing our 
 website; ironreign.github.io 
 </p>
 <p>
First we set up an introduction system so people could get to know us and then we created our first 
blogs, talking about the teardown of last year’s robot, primary scoring ideas, and the essay for the
 EKOCYCLE™ 3-D printer.  
 <h4> Reflections: </h4>
 The ability of the team to share its experiences and new realizations is a valuable asset, 
both for teams on the outside and also for us for when we have to reference back to past mistakes.
