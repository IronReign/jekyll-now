<h4> Task: Create final design for backboard</h4>
<p> Our old backboard was very nice in structure, however, as it was made out of paper and plastic Legos, it wouldn't have lasted for very long on the field. Our new design is 3D printed and is more solid all 
around the structure.

<br />
<h4> Reflections: </h4>
With the new design now in place, we have another toggle for the switch from home to scoring position:
<code>static bool backBoardbol = false; //only initial reading of pressed button causes toggle
		if ((joystick.joy1_TopHat == 2) || (joystick.joy2_TopHat == 2))
		{
			if (!backBoardbol)
			{
				if (servoTarget[BackBoard] != 54)
				{
					servoTarget[BackBoard] = 54;					
				}
				else
				{
					servoTarget[BackBoard] = 195;
				
				}
			}
			backboardbol = true;
		}
		else 
		{
			backboardbol = false;
		}
</code>
The toggle works for the right stick on the dpad and is an easy access next to the ski lift buttons. This now backboard completes our overall tele and now we have autonomous and driver practice to work on.
