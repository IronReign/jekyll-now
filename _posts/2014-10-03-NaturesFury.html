Yesterday, October 2nd, a storm blew across North Texas, 
wreaking havok on trees, backyards and many a robotics field. At least our robotics field.
Our field was stored in a large green tent. While we were at school,
the winds ravaged the city, and over 142,000 power outages occurred in Dallas alone. 
Although we did not suffer a power outage, our tent sustained severe damage, 
and parts were strewn across the yard. The once 4 meter tall tent got knocked back at least 3 meters,
and in the back half, it was knocked down to half its original height.
Our plans for starting to practice early in the season have been delayed at least 3 weeks,
and we are planning to gather the team together to repair the tent, if possible.
Luckily, the house didn't suffer any major damage.
