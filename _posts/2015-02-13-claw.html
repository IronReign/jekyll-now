<h4> Task: Make a new intake method for the balls</h4>
Our old beater bar intake for the game was deemed too big for our new scissor lift idea. Our new claw has a simple toggle set in the code:</br>
<code>
if (!(joy2Btn(8) == 1))
		{
			servoTarget[Claw] = 255;
		}
		else {
			servoTarget[Claw] = 100;
	}
	
</code> </br>
This allows for a simple hold of right trigger to keep the claw up, This allows for rapid intake(which was discussed in an earlier blog entry).

<h4> Reflections: </h4>
Our new designs and code are all coming together, constantly increasing our arsenal for use in the robot game. Our main goal of getting a rapid intake with contantly scoring balls (hopefully in the 90)
is a lot easier with the new claw. The simple code creation and output also gives a low margin of error.</p>
