<h4>Task: Improve Toggle Servo Coding </h4>
Our goal today was to code for the servo, utilized by the goal clamp, to have a basic toggle to switch the open/closed mechanism. This was accomplished with a boolean value switch within
an if/else group. Our boolean status is switched value and is initiated by the push of button 7 (right trigger for us). First the value of status is switched, initiating the gripperOpen or 
gripperClose methods.

task control()
{
	bool status = true;
	servoTarget[GoalClamp]=goalClosed;
	status=true;
	wait1Msec(1000);
	servoTarget[GoalClamp]=goalOpen; //hoo-ray
	wait1Msec(1000);

	while(true)
	{
		getJoystickSettings(joystick);
		if (joy1Btn(2) == 1 || joy2Btn(2) == 1) {servoTarget[GoalClamp]=goalClosed;} //PlayImmediateTone(1000, 5);}
		if (joy1Btn(4) == 1 || joy2Btn(4) == 1) {servoTarget[GoalClamp]=goalOpen;} //PlayImmediateTone(1000, 5);}
		
		if (joy1Btn(5) == 1 || joy2Btn(5) == 1) {motor[belt] = 100;}
		if (joy1Btn(6) == 1 || joy2Btn(6) == 1) {motor[belt] = 0;}
	}
}



<h4>Reflections: </h4>The simplicity of our design allows for easy fixes if needed and also makes it very readable. Withholding each if/else and alternating them with a while loop gives us accesskey
to the code and with the working toggle will give us all the more opportunity to score maximum points.
