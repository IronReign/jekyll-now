<h4> Task:Start Building Kibosh in Creo</h4>
	Today I started building the model of the Robot in an assembly in Creo. As I only had some experience
with parts, which is not the proper tool for this job, I decided to watch some videos on the basics of 
assemblies. After that I downloaded the models of the Tetrix parts off of the FTC website. So far, I
have built one half of the right drive train.
<h4> Reflections: </h4>
	Watching the how-to videos is important.
