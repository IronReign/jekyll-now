<h3>Task: Discuss the upcoming FTC Season </h3>
<p>
This meet we discussed topics concerning the upcoming FTC season. Our sister team, Imperial Robotics, was also over getting their robot 
working with the new motor controllers. We went over basics that we should do to be a better team this season. We went around deciding
tasks each member would be in charge of, whether it was logistics, organization, or our business plan. We also discussed how we should promote our team. Evan especially was enthusiastic about reaching out 
and taking charge of our business plan.

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
We realized that to be an accomplished team we each need to know we should be doing. With the game being released next Saturday, we will have 
to be precise in what we do and how we do thing this season.
