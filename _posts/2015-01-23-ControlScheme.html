<h4> Task: Assign control scheme to actual competition controller</h4>
<p>
Referencing the earlier article explaining robot functions needing to be assigned buttons, we had a 
meeting to get the control scheme actually implemented into the controllers. The picture above displays
the majority of the control scheme. Some values were changed such as the ski lift values.

<br />
<h4> Reflections: </h4>
With our control scheme now advancing to the testable stage, we now have the ability to alter values and fpcus
on the controls of possible future attachments (stay tuned for autonomous work). Our next series of blogs will
focus on each particular element in the  control scheme and focus on the critical thinking that went behind it all.
