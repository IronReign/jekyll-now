<h4> Task: Showcase our robot's driving chassis </h4>
Today, we went to our school, SEM, to meet with our sister FTC team, Imperial Robotics. 
We took one of the ramps, a large rolling goal and the center structure so that they
could get an idea of the size of the elements. Both teams tested driving their chassis up
the ramps, but theirs couldn't make it. They are experimenting with a omni-directional chassis
and it kept slipping sideways.  Ours was only a little better, but it was able to push a rolling goal
up the ramp.

We also shared some of our ideas for a beater bar and the lift mechanism.
<h4> Reflections: </h4>
With the blog well under way the team has taken to committing itself to outreach and spreading ideas ourselves. With input from other sources, we improve our designs while hopefully also
giving others ideas. This exchange of ideas is a positive for all sides of the echange and with continued spread, our designs and algorithms will only improve.
