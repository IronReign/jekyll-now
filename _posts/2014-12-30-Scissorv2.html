<h4> Task: Improve Scissor Structure</h4>
<p>
The first version of the Scissor lift was a basic prototype that wasn't meant to be the final design due to the flimsy, flexible design of the beams. The new version uses heavy steel beams
and are much more resistant to bending than the prototype. However, the bulk and density of the beams makes it very difficult to lift. We are looking into a lighter design of similar sturdiness.

<br />
<h4> Reflections: </h4>
The next version of the scissor lift has to be able to lift itself, hopefully through our first potential energy-bungie cord design.The bulk of the beams is currently causing the bungies to collapse
upon themselves.
