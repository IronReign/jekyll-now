<h3>Task: Share what we've learned about motion sensing</h3>

<p>
On July 11th we gave a talk for a classroom full of adult members of the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dprg.org">Dallas Personal Robotics Group (DPRG)</a>
 where we shared what we've learned and are still
learning about motion sensors, particularly gyros.  The talk took place at the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dallasmakerspace.org">Dallas Makerspace.</a>  Our thanks to DPRG, Steve and Doug for hosting us and recording
and editing the video.  The presentation slides can be 
<a target="_blank" href="../downloads/IronReignIntroToGyros.pdf">downloaded here.</a>  We hope this 
helps other FTC teams who are exploring the same subject.

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
We are fairly happy with how the presentation went.  We made a few mistakes and 
omissions in our talk and could improve our delivery.
We should probably have added one last slide of "dos and don'ts" to make it simpler for teams that are just starting with gyros, so we'll do that in a follow-up post.
</p><p> 
 Our assessment of the quality of the gyro in the 2nd gen Moto G isn't a first hand
assessment, as we don't actually own a Moto G. But if you Google the gyro on the Moto G you'll see stuff like this: 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/2syeb2/moto_2nd_gen_gyroscope_fix_request/">https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/2syeb2/moto_2nd_gen_gyroscope_fix_request/</a>
</p><p>
So it seems that using this phone with Google Cardboard leads to a very jerky
experience that probably means difficulty using it on a robot.  But it's also possible
that the gyro is fine and it's the built-in sensor fusion with the accelerometers and 
magnetometers that is the problem.  We are interested in feedback from other teams
that have this phone to see what they think of its gyro.  We know of at least one other
team that is planning to test this phone's gyro.
</p><p>
We are also interested in feedback from other teams on which external gyro they plan
to use.  The easy choice is the hitechnic gyro that we've mostly used in the past. But
the truth is that it is a very drifty gyro and there are probably better choices out
there now.  We are looking at a few ourselves and plan to post the results.
</p><p>
We estimate we've put about 90 person hours over 3 meets and a lot of homework
into this presentation.  And that doesn't count
the time we've put into actually learning how to use gyros from sensing through to control.
If we'd spent even half that time working on our FTC judging presentation last year we'd
be in much better shape.  We learned of some teams at the South Super Regional that spent
much more time practicing their presentations. We have to learn how to set aside time
in the weeks leading up to competition when our focus has been only on the robot.
