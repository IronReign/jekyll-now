<h4> Task: Test Autonomous and debugging </h4>
<p>
Today we were refining our ramp autonomous by debugging the gyro code. We found that 
our "goYonder" and "goBackward" method were affecting each other which was making 
our robot work incorrectly and just going crazy. 

<br />
<h4> Reflections: </h4>
Our approach to fixing our autonomous has yielded some promising results. When we started practice the autonomous code 
only worked every other time, failing when we compiled for the first time per connect and alternating from there.
We found the cause of the error, having two methods whith local variables of the same name.  We hadn't caught this 
earlier because normally local variables clear each time. Mr.Virani attributed this to Robot C being stupid.  When we 
zeroed the variable each time, the issue was fixed. Once that was resolved we were able to actually make progress 
on our ramp routine.
