<h4> Task:Finalize robot design for competition</h4>
With the scissor lift elevating with the screw-motor system, and the drive chain-claw system
for scoring the balls all in place, our robot is now officially ready for competition next week.
Our advantages lie in the stable,continuous driving chain of the robot and also our ability
to maintain a constant stream of scoring balls in a mostly stationary position.
<h4> Reflections: </h4>
Driving practice is now our main object of concern. We also need to put the finishing touched on the 
blog and also create a printing template for the actual journal we will present to the judges.
