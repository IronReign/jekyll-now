<h3>Task: Create preliminary designs for a new robot using a new build platform</h3>
<p>
Today I started making new designs for a competition robot based on extrusions and the new software platform.
</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
I decided to make two different possible designs, one based on our robot that we had used for the past few years with 1 regular wheel on each side in between two omni wheels, and another based on our sister team's 
newer platform, which had one standard wheel on each corner. After a few hours of work and no saving, creo crashed and I lost all of my work. Moral of the story : save your work more often.
