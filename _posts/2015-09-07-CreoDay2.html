<h3>Task: Create preliminary designs for a new robot using a new build platform</h3>

<p>
After we got the new mechanum wheels, I had to start thinking about a new design that would be able to use them.
</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
Not much progress was done on the design based on the mecanum wheels, but I remade part of the design based on our old robot from previous years.
We will build one robot based on our proven omniwheel-drivewheel-omniwheel nacelle design, only using the REV extrusion building system being
sold by Andymark.  We will build a second robot using mecanum wheels.  The plan is to see which robot works better and that will become our
competition robot and the other will become our sparring partner.  We think that our classic design will be better at pushing and resisting 
being pushed around.  We also know it is very capable of accurate turning.  But the mecanum robot will have more freedom of movement. Which
should work better is probably dependent on  what the challenge looks like when they release it. But we are also new to mecanum and
probably won't have a rock solid implementation figured out right away.
