<title> Create a List of Blog Tags</title>
</head>
<body>
By Caitlin <br />

<h3>Task: Make a list of tags for blog entries</h3>
<p>
We've been tagging each blog post as we write them according to topics we think they fall into, but there's been no standard for what to choose from.
For example, what I tag as "Mechanical" Omar tags as "Build."  When we get some scripting done on the blog to separate according to topic we will need consistency between everybody.
</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
So far these are the tags chosen to represent main topics and types of posts: <br />
@Team members: comment tag suggestions at the bottom of this article or in the group chat
<br />
<ul>
<li>Business - almost ALL outreach is under this tag too. grants won and companies talked too</li>
<li>Outreach - giving to the community, The team went out to an event, taught something, mentored a group etc</li>
<li>Mechanical - physically working on the robot or designs for that (omar's used "build" in the past, similar to that)</li>
<li>Software - programming, talking about sensors or something</li>
<li>Design - robot design (including arrangement of parts and wires), Creo mostly though</li>
<li>Organization - logistics about arrangement of tools, workspace stuff, may overlap with a lot of others</li>
<li>Journal - for when you've gotta get meta and blog about blogging</li>
<li>Tips - tips and tricks, something we think should be shared with other teams</li>
<li>Private - posts that contain trade secrets or something we don't want to share. won't be shown on the main blog page</li>
<li>Video - video is embedded somewhere in the post</li>
</ul>

Scripting will be used later to get some navigation / searching by topic, but we still need to go through previous entries from this season and replace old tags.
