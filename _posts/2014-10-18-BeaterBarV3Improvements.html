<h3>Task: Improve BeaterBar V3</h3>
<p>
Today we came up with a new attack angle for the beater bar. This new angle allows for greater accuracy for picking 
up the the large balls but missing the small ones. We also added a temporary mounting area for our NXT and wired up
the beater bar motor so it would not get snared when the ramp deploys. 
</p>
<h3>Reflections:</h3>
<p>
We have also finalized our plan to not pick up the smaller balls and have a large amount
of speed and accuracy picking up the larger balls. This is risky. We think many other teams
might be following the same strategy because of how much more efficient the large balls are
for racking up rolling goal height points.  If so, there will also be a lot of competition for
the limited number of large balls on the field.
Here are some tests:

<h4>Rejecting small balls</h4>

<p>
Our plan is to mount the NXT higher up on the side shields on the robot so it is protected but also accessible
during the tournament. But we can't really do that while we are changing the ball handling mechanisms
as much as we are. We don't want to be removing the shields constantly while we build.
