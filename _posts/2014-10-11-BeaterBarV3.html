<h3>Task: Build Better Beater Bar</h3>
<p>
Today we set out to build an upgraded version of the beater bar. We used square dowels from home depot to 
prevent the twist-ties from changing their orientation on the bar. We down the twist-ties and made a design that intakes the balls with 100% efficiency

</p>
<h3>Reflections:</h3>
<p>
With the 100% efficiency we can now move onto the tube mechanism to finally finish our scoring system. Our robot is approaching completition and with our parts coming together, we now 
face the task of connecting all these individual parts together.
