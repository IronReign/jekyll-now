<h4> Task: Make emergency scoring mechanism for competition </h4>
With competition only a week away, the team has decided that the rolling tube will not be able to be completed by the competition. We are now switching to a elevator based design with a
drive chain. This decision has opened up a multitiude of new builds and with a scissor- wedge design(elaborated in later posts), we believe the final version will help us in the 
qualifier(atleast more than an incomplete scoring tube).
<h4> Reflections:</h4>
This change has caused us to put the tube-based design to the side and hopefully come back to it if we qualify. The new design will be based along a grip chain with a claw being driven around
a beam along a certain platform. We have different ideas for the details of this design and will elaborate in the next post.
