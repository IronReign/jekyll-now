<h3>Task: Continue Build of Kibosh in Creo</h3>
<p>
	After finishing about 2/3 of the drive train, I came across the first custom part. We sliced a small
chunk off of the inner beam so we could install our goal catcher. Getting the alignment on the model to
be accurate for the real robot was a challenge, as the robot was in another room, and I'm pretty sure we
just eyeballed the cut in the first place, which meant there were no real recorded measurements I could
base the edit off of.
</p>
<h3>Reflections:</h3>
<p>
	I eventually created the custom part after taking some measurements, but it was a bit time consuming.
Document custom parts more often and with more detail.
