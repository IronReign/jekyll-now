<h3>Task: Getting a first glimpse at the new motors and controllers with Imperial robotics</h3>
<p>
We continued our meeting at the Dallas Makerspace after the GitHub tutorial. We unpackaged the new motors and motor controllers for the first time and took out the phones to scan the hardware configuration. We added Anderson Power poles to some of the motors. Caitlin taught Alisa and Ethan how to crimp wires and attach the power poles.

<h3>Reflections </h3>
<p>
Scanning the hardware configuration was very troublesome for us and the connections looked like a rat's nest and it was hard how it was going to fit together in a tidy bundle.
