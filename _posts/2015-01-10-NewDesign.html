<h4>Task: Position basket, chair, and drive chain </h4>
With the new design, we will be using a drive chain with "chairs" placed periodically 
along it. There will be a basket at the end of the ramp which will be catching the balls. 
The drive chain will then be moving the chairs to pick up the balls. As they reach the 
peak of the chain, the balls will be dropped off into the rolling goals. We found that with 
our current placement, the chairs are sometimes snagging the basket, but with some modifications 
we should be able to optimize our design. 

<h4>Reflections: </h4>
The design will also allow us to control the maximum number of balls and continuously 
score them as the chairs will always only be carrying up to the max number and dumping 
them off.
