<h3>Task: To review our last tournament</h3>
<h4>Beginnings</h4>
<p>
     Just like last tournament, we were late. However, thankfully, the tournament organizers were nearly as late as we were, with the tournament running thirty minutes behind. Also, us being late was not wholly a fault of our own, as we took the bus with <a href="http://www.imperialrobotics.com/">Imperial Robotics</a> 
</p>
<h4>Presentation</h4>
<p>
	Personally, I think we were great in our presentation. We were easily understood by the judges with our redesigned presentation. My only wish is that everyone had an equal share of talking in the presentation. For our amazing efforts in the presentation, we received the Think award.
</p>
<h4>Scouting</h4>
<p>
	Like last time, we were with Imperial, and like last time, we had trouble finding power at first. We kept using our scouting strategies this tournament (more on that later), and kept multiple spreadsheets.
	</p>

	</p>
	<p>
	These spreadsheets helped us decide who to partner with, which helped us greatly at the end. Dylan and Alisa walked around, interviewing team and watching their matches to log strengths and weaknesses. Dylan's crowning achievement was at the end. Due to multiple mistakes that will be discussed later, we ended out <strong>32nd place out of 32!</strong> Our many and enormous failures will be discussed later. Dylan (PBUH) and Alisa (PBUH) convinced the #1 team (again) that we were amazing, as if the essence of Jesus was distilled and dropped into each and every one of the team member's souls with this video.

	So from 32nd place, we were picked for an alliance by the #1 team.
</p>
<h4>Game</h4>
<p>
	First Game: We just get out of judging. In the first place, we nearly failed inspections due to the size of our robot. We were stuck on blocks the final match. Then, when we got to the mountain, we didn't have enough time to try to make it to the top. Our servo got caught and caused damage to the servo.
	<br>
	Second Game: Our robot lost connection as soon as we started driving.
	<br>
	Third Game: Our servos continually twitched, so we tried to do a power cycle, but the judges had never asked if we were ready or not and dumped the debris, so we couldn't touch the robot by that time.
	<br>
	Fourth Game: We got there late and the judges did not allow us to touch our controller.
	<br>
	Fifth Game: We got teamed up with Imperial. We actually won that one by climbing the mountain while Imperial cleared the debris.
	<br>
	In the alliance matches, we were partnered with The Fighting Pickles and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ftcsynergy5443">Synergy</a> who effectively carried us a bit.
	Sixth Game: We got to the high zone and our alliance parter got to the cliff. As well, Synergy placed a bunch of blocks in the midzone.
	<br>
	Seventh Game: We got into the high zone and the Pickles hung off the mountain. So overall, we got 3 wins in the tournament.
</p>
<h4>Awards Ceremony</h4>
<p>
	We got the Think award for our engineering process slides, a third place Inspire award for our outreach, mostly for this slide<p> <img src="../images/outreach_table"> </p>and a #1 Alliance award, letting us progress to qualifiers.
