<h3>Task: Improve Tube Joint</h3>
<p>
Today we published <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:490901">an updated version of our tube joint on Thingiverse.</a> 
This version of the tube joint added a third tab for extra durability, and a gradual slope was added leading up
from the base to the hinge tabs to allow it to print w/o structural support.
</p>
<h3>Reflections:</h3>
<p>
We asked for feedback from the 3D Fab(rication) Group at the <a href="http://dallasmakerspace.org/">Dallas Makerspace</a>.
They were the ones who told us that the hinge tabs looked a little weak. They also told us that we might want
to try printing w/ the part turned on its side, to avoid structural weakness derived from the layer separation.
</p>
<p>
Last time we were able to export our model as a 3ds file, but we lost that ability when our Sketchup pro features
expired. We searched around for another method, and we discovered we could export it as a Collada dae file
for Thingiverse.
