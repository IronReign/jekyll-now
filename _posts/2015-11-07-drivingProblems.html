<h3>Task: make sure the robot can run</h3>
<p>
There's a scrimmage next Saturday that we may or may not be going to based on Dallasisd technicalities with our team. 
Our goals for today were to get a basic autonomous going to dump climbers and maybe some mountain climbing tests. However, the controller apps needed to be updated and we got a lot of errors when connecting.
</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
If the controller gives an error mentioning "USB UART" apparently the only fix is to completely restart the robot controller phone :0  
It took us maybe 20 minutes to restart everything, but the robot is moving around.  It feels like we have to do this at least every other practice.
